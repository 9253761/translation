## CodeJava的说明

This article gives you an overview of all Java versions in its history, for Java Standard Edition (SE) Development Kit (JDK).

The latest version of Java is Java 12 or JDK 12 released on March, 19th 2019 (Follow this article to check Java version on your computer).

From the first version released in 1996 to the latest version 12 released in 2019, the Java platform has been actively being developed for about nearly 24 years. Many changes and improvements have been made to the technology over the years. The following table summarizes all versions of Java SE from its early days to the latest.


From the table above we can see that the naming and the version number have been changing over times:

- Versions 1.0 and 1.0 are named as JDK (Java Development Kit).
- From versions 1.2 to 1.4, the platform is named as J2SE (Java 2 Standard Edition).
- From versions 1.5, Sun introduces internal and external versions. Internal version is continuous from previous ones (1.5 after 1.4), but the external version has a big jump (5.0 for 1.5). This could make confusion for someone, so keep in mind that version 1.5 and version 5.0 are just two different version names for only one thing.

Major versions were released after every 2 years, however the Java SE 7 took 5 years to be available after its predecessor Java SE 6, and 3 years for Java SE 8 to be available to public afterward.

Since Java SE 10,  new versions will be released very six months.


## Oracle的说明


Most versions of the Java 2 Platform Standard Edition have an internal code or project name, as listed below. The dates listed are the final product release dates (following any beta releases). Feature releases are shown in bold.

Starting with Tiger, each version has two version numbers: an internal number, such as 1.5.0, and an external number, such as 5.0.

Since 1.2.2, major releases 1.3, 1.4.0, 5.0 and 6) are named after birds or mammals, while minor releases are named after insects, given that they are bug-fix releases. (Hopper is short for grasshopper and ladybird is another term for ladybug.)
