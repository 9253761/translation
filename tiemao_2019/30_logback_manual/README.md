# The logback manual

The complete logback manual documents the latest version of logback framework. In over 150 pages and dozens of concrete examples, it covers both basic and advanced logback features, including:

- the overall logback architecture
- discussion of best logback practices and anti-patterns
- logback configuration scripts in XML format
- appenders
- encoders
- layouts
- filters
- mapped diagnostic contexts
- Joran, logback's configuration system

The logback manual describes the logback API in considerable detail, including its features and design rationale. Authored by Ceki Gülcü and Sébastien Pennec, the main contributors to the logback project, the logback manual is intended for developers already familiar with the Java language but new to logback, as much as for experienced logback users. With the aid of introductory material and many examples, new users should quickly come up to speed.
